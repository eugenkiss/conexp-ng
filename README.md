![Logo](logo_small.png) ConExp-NG
=================================

ConExp-NG is a simple GUI-centric tool for the study & research of Formal
Concept Analysis (FCA) that allows you to create formal contexts, draw concept
lattices and explore dependencies between attributes. ConExp-NG, whose name
stands for *Concept Explorer Next Generation*, is not an entirely original
creation but a modern reimplementation of a similar tool by the name of [Concept
Explorer][1] with a focus on usability, maintainability and extensibility.
